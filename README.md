### Round 3

- Disconnect from the `classroom` database connection
- Connect to the `food` database connection

This Round is going to require you to get curious about your surroundings. At some point in your path as a developer, you will work on a project that already has an existing database. That database may be quite old, or have been built on a different set of standards.

These questions will be focused on exploring an unknown database that does not follow the standards we have established in class. See if you can work out answers to the following questions:


1. What table contains information about individual food items? 

Answer:food_desc

2. Using the table from the previous answer as your starting point - what table do you think contains Food Group information about individual foods?

Answer:fd_group

3. Write a query to get the name of a food, and its corresponding food group name 

```
Paste your query below:
select fd.shrt_desc, fg.fddrp_desc
	from food_des fd inner join fd_group fg
    	on fd.fdgrp_cd = fg.fdgrp_cd
;

```

4. Identify the table that has information about data sources

Answer:data_src

5. Using the table from your previous answer, write a query that will get the oldest data source

```
Paste your query below:select * from data_src
 order by year asc
  limit 1;

```

6. How many foods contain "Egg" in their description?

Answer: 101
select count(*) from food_des where long_desc ilike '%egg%';


7. Write a query that will return a count of foods in each food group

```
Paste your query below:
select count(fd_group.fddrp_desc), fd_group.fddrp_desc from food_des
join fd_group
on food_des.fdgrp_cd = fd_group.fdgrp_cd
group by fd_group.fddrp_desc;
```
